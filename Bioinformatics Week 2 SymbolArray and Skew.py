SymbolArray('AAAAGGGG', 'A')
#Line above to be used to test the code. 

#For SymbolArray('AAAAGGGG', 'A'), n = 8. Extended Genome states to make a new string that consists of parts 'AAAAGGGG' + 'AAAA' (since brackets are stating from 0 to 4, but the 4 is exclusive so it's actually index positions 0 to 3) 
#i in range(n) would mean i goes from 0 to 7 since range is exclusive of the last number. That means that there will be seven array values with indices from 0 to 7. 
#for the first cycle, the starting array @ 0th index = Pattern Count function. 
#For the patternCount function, it's taking ExtendedGenome[i: i+ n(//2)] and symbol as inputs. 
#in the for loop, the range will be from length of ExtendedGenome[i: i+ n(//2)] - len of symmbol + 1. Since len of symbol =1, then the -1 and +1 will cancel out. 
#len of ExtendedGenome[i:i+(n//2)] is 4. Therefore, the range in the PatternCount definition is 4. It counts from 0 to 3. 
#Therefore, in the first iteration, the for loop in PatternCount will change from 0 to 3 every single time. Now to the if loop. 
#in the if loop, it's checking every single character in the window established by ExtendedGenome[i:i+(n//2)] is equal to the symbol. If it does, add 1 to the count.  
#For the first iteration of the SymbolArray function, the if loop in PatternCount will check indices 0 to 3. That's why in the first iteration of Symbol Array, array[i] is 4. 
#In the second iteration of SybmolArray, you are checking indices 1 to 4. The for loop in PatternCount ensures that you iterate through indices 1 to 4 (the for loop iterates 4 times, but the range remains the same as to 0 to 4), and the if loop is the code that checks if index 1 is equal to pattern, index 2 is equal to pattern, and so forth in the established window. 

# Symbolarray definition is slow because it iterates through len(Genome) times! 
# Then, to compute PatternCount(ExtendedGenome[i+i(n//2)], symbol) we individually compare symbol against n//2 symbols 
# In combination, that means thereâ€™s (n^2)//2 comparisons to execute
